    term instance with same shell command once enabled. #344
### 27/12/2021

    window.
### 23/09/2020
  - Add `jupyter console` as a valid python REPL.

### 06/08/2020

### 28/07/2020
  - Add clear default values for neoterm.

### 27/07/2020
  - Dynamically set neoterm window size with `:Topen resize=N` and
    `:Ttoggle resize=N`. ([\#289](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/289))
  - Add a CHANGELOG enforcer action.
  - Fixes creation of extra buffer. ([\#294](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/294))

### 26/07/2020
  - Add option `g:neoterm_bracketed_paste` to allow sending text to terminal in bracketed paste mode. ([\#295](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/295))

### 29/04/2020
  - Add a `shell` option on `neoterm#new` to be able to handle

### 19/04/2020
  - refactor `:Tmap`. Use the `g:neoterm_automap_keys` to call `neoterm#map_do`,
    which will use the new `g:neoterm.map_options` to run `neoterm#do`
  - `g:neoterm_repl_commands` supports lists
  - neoterm#repl#exec supports filetype specific execution
  - Fix problems sending code blocks with blank lines to ipython or python repl
    ([\#273](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/273))
  - Paste Magic to send a code block to ipthon cells
    ([\#270](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/270))
  - Added a python specfic repl file

### 17/04/2020
  - Update how _last active_ is updated. Also document when it's updated.

### 14/04/2020
  - Add an error message when trying to close neoterm, and it's the last opened
    window, with `:Tclose`.

### 13/04/2020
  - Add support to neoterm ID in the `:Tmap`. ([\#276](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/276))
  - Allow to set `g:neoterm_marker` to empty. ([\#277](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/277))
  - Add a [contributing guide](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - Add `:Tls` to list neoterm instances
  - Change the ID calculation. To avoid big ID numbers, the ID is reseted to 1
    when there is no instance of a neoterm windows open.

### 12/04/2020
  - [neovim only] Add neoterm id on the buffer name. ([\#272](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/272))
  - Fix `:Tclose` and `:TcloseAll`. When the default behavior changed to not
    replace the current buffer these commands stop working. To fix, besides
    saving the window of orignin, not the buffer of origin is also being saved,
    when closing a neoterm buffer if there's no window to return, neoterm will
    return to the origin buffer. ([\#271](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/271))

### 08/04/2020
  - Fix `:Tclear!`, the minimum value for `scrollback` is `1`, not `0`. ([\#267](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/267))
  - Add option `g:neoterm_repl_r` to set the REPL for the R files. ([\#264](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/264))

### 04/04/2020
  - Improve the documentation.
  - Change default behavior to not delete the current buffer, instead creates a
    new buffer for the neoterm. By default, it'll still use the current window,
    but no the current buffer.
  - Add `g:neoterm_clear_cmd` to configure how to clear the terminal.

### 16/03/2020
  - Extract changelog to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  - Revamp README and documentation.

### 14/03/2020
  - Add support for [`jshell`](https://github.com/christo-auer/neoterm.git)(Java REPL).

### 14/02/2020
  - Add support for [`evcxr`](https://github.com/google/evcxr)(Rust REPL).

### 11/11/2019
  - Fix bug with `g:neoterm_fixedsize`. ([\#255](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/255))

### 07/11/2019
  - Remove `TermClose` neoterm destroy action. This is already called via
      `on_exit` callback. ([\#252](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/252))
  - Fix neoterm on vim. Vim doesn't accept marked shell.
      ([\#251](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/251))
  - Fix exception when trying to send a command to an inexistent neoterm buffer.
      ([\#254](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/254))

### 01/09/2019
  - Use a proper terminal marker for each OS. Unix-like uses `;#neoterm` and
    windows uses `&::neoterm`. (Same strategy used on
    [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/commit/5097e563df9c066e307b7923283cf1609ede693e)) ([#246](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/246))

### 20/08/2019
  - Destroy managed neoterm buffer loaded from session
  - Refactor the neoterm target function, the function the retrieves the desired
    neoterm to act on, to its own autoload function set (neoterm#target#).
  - Only manage neoterm terminals with `TermOpen`. ([#243](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/243))

### 19/08/2019
  - Only use `TermOpen` when it' available. ([#243](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/243))

### 18/08/2019
  - Enable neoterm to manage any terminal buffer. The TermOpen event is being
    used to associate neovim terminal with neoterm.
  - Remove deprecated `g:neoterm_open_in_all_tabs` and fix
    `g:neoterm_term_per_tab` ([#237](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/237)).
  - Better message when trying to execute a command on an already closed
    neoterm. Instead of show the error stacktrace just shows the message:
    "neoterm-X not found (probably already closed)" ([#242](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/242))

### 21/06/2019
  - Fix bug with window resizing for non-default mods ([#239](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/239)).

### 07/06/2019
  - `g:neoterm_keep_term_open` keeps hidden terminals open even if they are
    closed without using `:Tclose`

### 11/03/2019
  - Make the `signcolumn=auto` in neoterm buffer.

### 29/01/2019
  - Improve `g:neoterm_open_in_all_tabs` documentation.

### 21/12/2018
  - Add `g:neoterm_term_per_tab`, a way to send the commands to the term
    associated to the vim tab.
  - fix `:Topen` without `g:neoterm_default_mod` wasn't re-opening neoterm
    buffer.

### 17/11/2018
  - add `:Tclear!`, this will clear the neoterm buffer scrollback (history)

### 12/11/2018
  - Use `chansend` instead of `jobsend`, which was deprecated.

### 12/11/2018
  - Fix `E119: Not enough arguments for function: <SNR>112_repl_result_handler`

### 09/11/2018
  - Yet another work with '%' expandability.
    - '%' will be expanded to the current file path, respect g:neoterm_use_relative_path;
    - '\%' will be expanded to '%', not the current file path, useful in Windows.

### 20/07/2018
  - `\%` Will not expand the `%`. (Escaping the `%`)

### 03/03/2018
  - **DEPRECATE g:neoterm_split_on_tnew** - `:Tnew` now accepts vim mods (`:help mods`).
  - Introduce `g:neoterm_tnew_mod` to set a default `:Tnew` mod (`:help mods`).
  - Revamp `:Topen`. Now `:[mods][N]Topen` accepts vim mods (`:h mods`) and a
    target, so if one wants to open the neoterm with id 2 in vertical, one can
    do `:vert 2Topen`.
  - Revamp `:Tclose`. Now `:[N]Tclose[!]` accepts a target, so one can close any
    neoterm by its id.
  - Fix a bug with `:[N]Ttoggle` and also make it accepts the neoterm id.

### 04/03/2018
  - Revamp `:[N]Ttoggle`, now it accepts vim mods (`:help mods`) when the toggle
    is opening the neoterm.
  - Revamp `:[N]T`, now it accepts the target, so one can send the command for
    any neoterm by id, like, to send commands to the neoterm 3, one can do
     `:3T ls`.
  - **DEPRECATE T[N], Topen[N], Tclose[N], Tclear[N], Tkill[N]** - The neoterm
    id was moved to the beginning of the command, so instead of `:T2`, for
    example, one must use `:2T`.

### 07/03/2018
  - Do not call `:bdelete!` if buffer does not exist `term#destroy` was calling
    `neoterm#close` which was causing a cyclic call to `:bdelete!
    <neoterm.buffer_id>`.

### 08/03/2018
  - Add vim's terminal support! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### 15/03/2018
  - Fix bug where `:[N]T` wasn't accepting quoted arguments, like:
    `:T echo "ls"`.
  - Make handlers/callbacks work in vim. Destroy instance when destroying a
    terminal.

### 18/03/2018
  - Deprecate `g:neoterm_tnew_mod` and `g:neoterm_position` in favor of
    `g:neoterm_default_mod`, which will be used for every new neoterm window.
  - Add the feature of the _last active_ neoterm. When sending a command or
    navigating among neoterms the last one will be marked as the last active and
    it'll be used by default in the next commands.
