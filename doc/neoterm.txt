1. Intro                                                         *neoterm-intro*

1.1 What is neoterm?                                   *neoterm-what-is-neoterm*

neoterm is a neovim terminal wrapper. Its main goal is to provide an easier
way to interact with neovim's terminal.

1.2 Default behavior                                  *neoterm-default-behavior*

neoterm, by default, will create a new neoterm buffer on the current window.
This can be changed with `g:neoterm_default_mod`.

1.3 Multiple terminal support                *neoterm-multiple-terminal-support*

neoterm is capable of controlling more than one terminal at a time. To open a
new terminal, use |:Tnew|. Each neoterm terminal has an `ID` (neoterm jobs are
always named `neoterm-ID`). Each neoterm terminal has its own set of commands
prefixed by its `ID`. For instance, `:1T` `command` will always send the command
to neoterm `1`.

Commands lacking a prefix will always be executed in the last active neoterm.

1.4 ID calculation                                      *neoterm-id-calculation*

The ID is a numeric value. It's calculates the minimum available value,
starting from 1.

1.4 Last Active                                            *neoterm-last-active*

neoterm last active is updated on the following events:
  - `:Tnew`
  - `:T`
  - `:Texec`
  - `:Topen`
  - `:Ttoggle` - if it opens a neoterm

===============================================================================
                                                              *neoterm-commands*
2. Commands

:[N]T {cmd}                                                                 *:T*

Executes the given command on the neoterm with id [N]. With no [N] the last
active neoterm will be used (or a new one will be created). If a new neoterm
window is created, mods are accepted to position the new window. If there is a
`%` in the given command, this will be expanded to the current file path.

:[N]Texec {cmds}                                                        *:Texec*

Executes the given commands, one by one, on the neoterm with id [N]. With no
[N] the last active neoterm will be used or a new one will be created. If
there is a `%` in the given command, this will be expanded to the current file
path.

:Tnew                                                                    *:Tnew*

Opens a new term buffer. This command accepts |mods| like `:vertical`,
`:botright`, `:belowright`, etc. By default it'll use the current window. Its
default behavior can be changed with |g:neoterm_default_mod|.

:[N]Tclear[!]                                                          *:Tclear*

Clear the neoterm with [N] id. With no [N] the last active neoterm will be
cleared. This command will send a <C-L> to neoterm.

When the [!] is included the buffer 'scrollback' cleaned (it is set to 1 and
then set back to the original value).

:[N]Tkill                                                               *:Tkill*

Kills the process in the neoterm with [N] id. With no [N] the last active
neoterm will be killed. This command will send a <C-K> to neoterm.

:[N]Tmap {cmd}                                                           *:Tmap*

Maps the given command to the neoterm with [N] id. With no [N] the last active
neoterm will be the map target. Each time the mapping is executed the command
is sent to a neoterm terminal buffer.

When the `Tmap` is executed the "last active" won't be updated, not affecting
future commands.

The default mapping is `,tt`. It can be changed in |g:neoterm_automap_keys|.

:Tpos {position}                                                         *:Tpos*

DEPRECATED - Commands like |:T| and |:Tnew| accept vim mods (|mods|). If you
want to choose the default mod use in one of these commands see
|g:neoterm_default_mod|.

:TREPLSetTerm {term-id}                                          *:TREPLSetTerm*

Chooses, or changes, the current neoterm to run the REPL commands.

:TREPLSendFile                                                  *:TREPLSendFile*

Sends the current file to a REPL.

:TREPLSendLine                                                  *:TREPLSendLine*

Sends the current line to a REPL.

:TREPLSendSelection                                        *:TREPLSendSelection*

Sends the current selection to a REPL.

:[N]Topen [resize=V]                                                    *:Topen*

Opens the neoterm with id [N]. With no [N] the last active neoterm will be
opened or a new one will be created. This command accepts vim |mods|. The last
|mods| used will be saved in the neoterm instance.

'resize=V' option can be passed, this will resize the new window to the given
size. The resize will be used in the direction of the |mods| used. The value
will also be cached in the neoterm instance.

:[N]Tclose[!]                                                          *:Tclose*

Closes, or hides, the neoterm with id [N]. With no [N] the last active neoterm
will be closed.

When the [!] is included the |g:neoterm_keep_term_open| is ignored and the
neoterm buffer is deleted.

:TcloseAll[!]                                                       *:TcloseAll*

Call |:Tclose| for each neoterm instance.

When the [!] is included `:Tclose!`(with the bang) is called.

:[N]Ttoggle [resize=V]                                                *:Ttoggle*

Toggles the neoterm with id [N]. With no [N] the last active neoterm will be
toggled.  This command accepts vim |mods|. The last |mods| used will be saved
in the neoterm instance.

'resize=V' option can be passed, this will resize the new window to the given
size. The resize will be used in the direction of the |mods| used. The value
will also be cached in the neoterm instance.

:TtoggleAll                                                        *:TtoggleAll*

Toggles all neoterm windows in the current tab.

List neoterm instances.

:Tnext                                                                  *:Tnext*

Navigate to the next neoterm instance, works like `:bnext`.

:Tprevious                                                          *:Tprevious*

Navigate to the previous neoterm instance, works like `:bprevious`.

2.1 Dynamic Mappings

One can map commands to be sent to specific neoterm windows. For example,

    `" 3<leader>tl will clear neoterm-3 window`
    `nnoremap <leader>tl :<c-u>exec v:count.'Tclear'<cr>`

===============================================================================
3. Options                  *neoterm-vars* *neoterm-variables* *neoterm-options*

                                                    *g:neoterm_direct_open_repl*

When set, the neoterm terminal will open directly to the set REPL rather than
using the shell as an intermediary.
Default value: `0`.

                                                        *g:neoterm_automap_keys*

When set to 1 neoterm will send the commands to the neoterm buffer linked to
the current tab instead of the last active neoterm.
Default value: 0

                                                      *g:neoterm_keep_term_open*

When set, neoterm terminal will be kept running in background when the buffer
is hidden, or when closing via |:Tclose|. When not set, `:bdelete!` is used to
close neoterm in |:Tclose|.
Default value: `1`.

                                                          *g:neoterm_autoinsert*

                                                            *g:neoterm_autojump*

When set, neoterm will open in normal mode, and will not go back to the
previous window. When |g:neoterm_autoinsert| is set, this option has no effect.
Default value: `0`.

                                                       *g:neoterm_split_on_tnew*

DEPRECATED - |:Tnew| now accepts |mods|. |:Tnew| will use current window by
default, but you can use `:vert Tnew`, for example, to open a new neoterm
vertical split.


                                                            *g:neoterm_tnew_mod*

Default vim mod (|mods|) when creating or toggling a neoterm window. To see
the possible values of this variable check `:help mods` , many users use
`botright` to open the neoterm in a new window split.
Default value: ''


                                                   *g:neoterm_use_relative_path*

When set, the `%` will always be expanded to the file relative path instead of
its absolute path.
Default value: 0

                                                           *g:neoterm_repl_ruby*

Default value: irb

                                                         *g:neoterm_repl_python*

Sets what python REPL will be used, and any arguments to be passed to it.
This option accepts either a String or a list of commands. Its default
value is an empty string, which will try to use `ipython` or `python`,
in this order, to execute the REPL.
Default value: (empty)

Example for a valid command list:
`let g:neoterm_repl_python = ['conda activate venv', 'clear', 'ipython']`

In this example ipython is loaded in a virtual environment.
The screen output is cleared after activating the venv.

                                                              *g:neoterm_repl_r*

Sets what R REPL will be used.
Default value: R

                                                      *g:neoterm_repl_octave_qt*

When set, the Octave REPL will use Qt widgets for plots, dialogs, etc.
Internally, this means the REPL is set to `octave` `--no-gui`. Otherwise the
REPL is set to `octave-cli`. This setting is for Octave 4 and has no effect
for Octave 3 users.
Default value: `0`

                                                            *g:neoterm_repl_php*

Sets what php REPL will be used, and any arguments to be passed to it.
Defaults to an empty string, in which case NeoTerm will fall back to psysh
followed by php.
Default value: (empty)

                                                                 *g:neoterm_eof*

Sets how neoterm will send the `EOF` character to terminal.
Default value: ""

                                                          *g:neoterm_autoscroll*

When set to `1` neoterm will scroll to the end of its buffer after running any
command or using :TOpen for when the terminal is hidden.
Default value: `0`

                                                           *g:neoterm_fixedsize*

When set to `1` neoterm will fix the height and width of its window with
`winfixheight` and `winfixwidth`. This option only works when the
|g:neoterm_size| is set.
Default value: `0`

                                                       *g:neoterm_auto_repl_cmd*

When set to `1` neoterm will automatically open a terminal window and start the
REPL for you. If set to `0` it will leave you in the shell.
Default value: `1`

                                                               *g:neoterm_shell*

Sets the shell used inside neoterm.
neovim default: `&shell . ' ' . substitute(&shellcmdflag, '[-/]c', '', '')`
vim default: `&shell`
                                                      *g:neoterm_command_prefix*

When set, is used as the prefix to any text sent to the neoterm terminal.
This can be useful if your shell or REPL is configured to use vi-mode editing
to ensure the mode is set to insertion mode.   For instance when using a shell
or REPL in vi-mode, setting this to `"\edda"` will clear the current line then
leave the prompt in insertion mode.
Default value: ''

                                                           *g:neoterm_clear_cmd*

Sets how to clear the terminal on `:Tclear`. By default it uses the keybinding
`ctrl-l`, but it can be replaced by the command `clear`
Default value: `["\<c-l>"]`
To use the clear command set to: `["clear", ""]`

                                                      *g:neoterm_bracketed_paste*

When set to `1` neoterm will send text to the neoterm buffer in bracketed
paste mode. This is useful to enable sending multiline statements when working
with some interactive REPL environments (such as radian for R and ipython for
Python). Note that when used with pure python, can give `SyntaxError: multiple
statements found while compiling a single statement`.
Default value: `0`

===============================================================================
4. Callbacks                                                  *neoterm-callbacks*

Callbacks are functions that are called before/after a neoterm event. They can
be set in the global variable `g:neoterm_callbacks`.

                                               *g:neoterm_callbacks.before_new()*

This callback is called before a neoterm is created with any command, like
`:Tnew`, `:Topen`, `:Ttoggle`, etc.

- Example of usage:

Open the neoterm in a vertical split if current window width is bigger than
100, otherwise use a horizontal split.
>
    let g:neoterm_callbacks = {}
    function! g:neoterm_callbacks.before_new()
      if winwidth('.') > 100
        let g:neoterm_default_mod = 'botright vertical'
      else
        let g:neoterm_default_mod = 'botright'
      end
    endfunction

                                               *g:neoterm_callbacks.before_exec()*

This callback is called before neoterm sends a command to its terminal, like
in `:T`.

- Example of usage:

Save all buffers before executing a command
>
    let g:neoterm_callbacks = {}
    function! g:neoterm_callbacks.before_exec()
      wall
    endfunction
<

5. Operators                                                 *neoterm-operators*

                                                     *<Plug>(neoterm-repl-send)*

Keymap for sending contents to REPL, works with |text-objects|. For example,
>
    " Use gx{text-object} in normal mode
    nmap gx <Plug>(neoterm-repl-send)

    " Send selected contents in visual mode.
    xmap gx <Plug>(neoterm-repl-send)
<
With these mappings, you could use `gxip` to send a paragraph to a REPL, or send
selected contents with `gx` in visual mode.

                                                *<Plug>(neoterm-repl-send-line)*

Like |<Plug>(neoterm-repl-send)|, but for lines. For example,
>
    nmap gxx <Plug>(neoterm-repl-send-line)
<
Then you could use `gxx` or `2gxx` to send current or 2 lines to REPL.
