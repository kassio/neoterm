# neoterm

Use the same terminal for everything. The main reason for this plugin is reuse
the terminal easily. All commands opens a terminal if it's not open or reuse the
open terminal.
REPL commands, opens a terminal and the proper REPL, if it's not opened.

- NeoVim terminal helper functions/commands.
- Wraps some REPL to receive current line or selection.
- Many terminals support:

## test libs (removed on 05/Feb/2017)

*This feature was removed on 05/Feb/2017, please consider to use the
vim-test with `neoterm` strategy to replace this feature*

- [Related issue](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/issues/123).

## REPL

* `TREPLSend`: sends the current line or the selection to a REPL in a terminal.
* `TREPLSendFile`: sends the current file to a REPL in a terminal.

### REPLs supported

* Ruby: `pry` and `irb`
* Rails: `bundle exec rails console`
* Python: `ipython` and `python`
* JavaScript: `node`
* Elixir: `iex`
* Julia: `julia`
* R / R Markdown: `R`
* Haskell: `ghci`
* Idris: `idris`
* GNU Octave: `octave`
  * For Octave 4.0.0 and later, you can enable Qt widgets (dialogs, plots, etc.) using `g:neoterm_repl_octave_qt = 1`
* MATLAB: `matlab -nodesktop -nosplash`
* PARI/GP: `gp`
* PHP: `psysh` and `php`

### Troubleshooting
The REPL is set using the filetype plugin so make sure to set
```viml
filetype plugin on
```

Most standard file extensions for the above REPLs are picked up by Neovim's default
filetype plugins. However, there are two exceptions:
* Julia `.jl` files, which are detected as `filetipe=lisp`
* Idris `.idr`, `.lidr` files which are not recognised as any filetype
To fix this, either install a suitable plugin for the language or add something like
the following to your `init.vim`:
```viml
au VimEnter,BufRead,BufNewFile *.jl set filetype=julia
au VimEnter,BufRead,BufNewFile *.idr set filetype=idris
au VimEnter,BufRead,BufNewFile *.lidr set filetype=lidris
```

## other useful commands:

* `:T <command>`: Opens a terminal, or use an opened terminal, and runs the
                  given command within a terminal.
* `:Tmap <command>`: maps a the given command to `,tt`.
